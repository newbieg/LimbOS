# OSDev01
My own 32 bit Operating System

## details:
Currently developement is in the very basics of OS design. I am aiming for a useable 32 bit computer with a command line interface. While GUI, 64 bit, and cross-compiled programs are not off the table, they are not in any way a priority with this OS.

Only major advancements will merit a bump in the version name. Currently this OS doesn't even have a name, so we're in verion -0.0.1, as soon as it advances to having a useable CLI I'll consider taking it out of negative numbers. 


#Build Instructions:
Currently the OS does not have the ability to write anything to file, so it remains a recomendation that it be built as an iso file. Right now the Makefile is written to automate the entire process, just type make in the main project folder. (After following the setup from OSDEV about building a cross-compiler word-for-word currently found at http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)
