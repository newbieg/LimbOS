# OSDev01
My own 32 bit Operating System

## details:
Currently developement is in the very basics of OS design. I am aiming for a useable 32 bit computer with a command line interface. While GUI, 64 bit, and cross-compiled programs are not off the table, they are not in any way a priority with this OS.

Only major advancements will merit a bump in the version name. Currently this OS doesn't even have a name, so we're in verion -0.0.1, as soon as it advances to having a useable CLI I'll consider taking it out of negative numbers.
